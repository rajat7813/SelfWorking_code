                                <head xml:id="_78eb8c0007">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</head>
                                <p n="0002" xml:id="_78eb8c0008">The present disclosure relates to a medical device, and, more particularly, to a surgical instrument.</p>
                                <head xml:id="_78eb8c0009">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</head>
                                <p n="0003" xml:id="_78eb8c0010">A variety of surgical procedures are performed through a very small surgical incision in a particular tissue. Reducing the size of a surgical incision during a surgical procedure generally reduces the amount of trauma
                                    to the surgical site and generally facilitates faster wound healing. In order to perform surgical procedures through a very small surgical incision, a surgeon may require specialized surgical instruments configured to fit through the very small
                                    surgical incision and provide the surgeon with a surgical utility. Sometimes a surgeon may require a surgical utility that may not be easily controlled close to a particular surgical site, e.g., closing forceps jaws inside of an eye. It is generally
                                    desirable for a surgeon to be able to control such a surgical utility with a minimal amount of effort. For example, if a surgical utility is controlled by a lever or a switch on an instrument handle, a surgeon may need to adjust an orientation of a
                                    surgical instrument in order to actuate the lever or the switch. Additionally, if a surgical utility control mechanism requires a surgeon to apply a significant amount of force to a portion of a surgical instrument, then it may be difficult for the
                                    surgeon to manipulate the surgical utility control mechanism without unintentionally moving a portion of the surgical instrument.</p>

                                <p n="0004" xml:id="_78eb8c0011">Ophthalmic surgical instruments are generally categorized as either reusable or single-use. A single-use instrument is typically sterilized prior to sale and is shipped to a surgery center sterile and ready for use in
                                    a surgical procedure. A reusable instrument is typically shipped to a surgery center non-sterile and is sterilized by the surgery center between uses in surgery. Reusable instruments are generally lower in overall cost for a surgery center compared
                                    to single-use instruments. Single-use instruments offer a surgery center greater convenience compared to reusable instruments. Accordingly, there is a need for an instrument that offers a surgery center the convenience of a single-use instrument at
                                    the overall lower cost of a reusable instrument.</p>

                                <head xml:id="_a9bac10007">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</head>
                                <p n="0002" xml:id="_a9bac10008">The present disclosure relates to a medical device, and, more particularly, to a surgical instrument.</p>
                                <head xml:id="_a9bac10009">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</head>
                                <p n="0003" xml:id="_a9bac10010">A variety of surgical procedures are performed through a very small surgical incision in a particular tissue. Reducing the size of a surgical incision during a surgical procedure generally reduces the amount of trauma
                                    to the surgical site and generally facilitates faster wound healing. In order to perform surgical procedures through a very small surgical incision, a surgeon may require specialized surgical instruments configured to fit through the very small
                                    surgical incision and provide the surgeon with a surgical utility. Sometimes a surgeon may require a surgical utility that may not be easily controlled close to a particular surgical site, e.g., closing forceps jaws inside of an eye. It is generally
                                    desirable for a surgeon to be able to control such a surgical utility with a minimal amount of effort. For example, if a surgical utility is controlled by a lever or a switch on an instrument handle, a surgeon may need to adjust an orientation of a
                                    surgical instrument in order to actuate the lever or the switch. Additionally, if a surgical utility control mechanism requires a surgeon to apply a significant amount of force to a portion of a surgical instrument, then it may be difficult for the
                                    surgeon to manipulate the surgical utility control mechanism without unintentionally moving a portion of the surgical instrument.</p>

                                <p n="0004" xml:id="_a9bac10011">Ophthalmic surgical instruments are generally categorized as either reusable or single-use. A single-use instrument is typically sterilized prior to sale and is shipped to a surgery center sterile and ready for use in
                                    a surgical procedure. A reusable instrument is typically shipped to a surgery center non-sterile and is sterilized by the surgery center between uses in surgery. Reusable instruments are generally lower in overall cost for a surgery center compared
                                    to single-use instruments. Single-use instruments offer a surgery center greater convenience compared to reusable instruments. Accordingly, there is a need for an instrument that offers a surgery center the convenience of a single-use instrument at
                                    the overall lower cost of a reusable instrument.</p>
